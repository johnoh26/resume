# History of this project

From when I graduated my bootcamp (Fullstack Academy) in 2020 to 2022,

I created a quick but good looking portfolio website using Gatsby.js and hosted it on Netlify with a custom domain "www.john-oh.com".

The custom domain was costing me about $20 a year.

Small amount, but I thought it was unnecessary.

To be frugal, I decided to create this Github Page: https://johnoh26.github.io/resume/ to replace my portfolio site.
